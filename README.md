# sparse-radar-applications

This is the final project for ELEN-6867 at Columbia University completed in April 2022. This project investigates the application of sparse representation theory to radar applications including sub-Nyquist signal reconstruction, sparse aperture direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, and simultaneous sparse DoA estimation and signal reconstruction.  

The [final report](ayr2111_Final_Report.pdf) is available as a PDF in this repository which cab be read in the browser.
